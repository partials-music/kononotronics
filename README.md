# verse one

I, I ended up in a city
  I, I stumbled up on a city
but hearing another city where my friends cant
  but hearing another city where my friends speak
  cemented inside a shadow while the sun beat
  I ended up in a ruin where the noon beats
  I ended up in a ruin where the sun beats
  I wandered a ruined city where the sun beats
  A ruin, a silent city where the sun beats
  I ended up in a city where the sun beats
  I stumbled onto a city where the sun beats down
I, I ended up in a wasteland
  I, I ended up in a deep sleep
  I, I ended up in a secret
  I, I stumbled up on a city
and speaking a tongue my friends can't understand
  befriending a silent city where the sun beat down
  A ruin, a silent city where the noon beats down
  A ruin, a silent city where the sun beats down
  I wandered a silent city where the sun beats down
  I stumbled up on a city where the sun beats down
  I found myself in a city where the sun beats down

# verse two

I, I found myself in a building
and damming the many rivers that the roof leaked
  descending the many rivers that the roof leaked
  drowning in many rivers that the roof leaked
  descending the many rivers where the roof leaks
  descending the many rivers of the roof leaks
  A refuge, a rocky temple where the roof leaks
  I found myself in a temple where the roof leaks
I, I found myself in a heartbeat
I found myself in a heartbeat when the roof leaks were drowning me
  I found myself in a city when the roof leaks were drowning me
  I found myself in a temple where the roof leaks were drowning me

# chorus

we've always known that somewhere is home
we've always known that somewhere is home
when I arrived you were the first to go
  when I was looking you were the first to go
  when I was thirsty you were the flood below
  while I was seeking you found it on your own
we've always known that elsewhere is home

# verse three

I, I ended up ever homeless
just sipping the moonlight steeping in my gold cup
  just sipping the moonlight steeping in my tin cup
  just sipping the moonlight steeping in empty cups
I, I ended up never noticed
and daily a feast of air to fill me up
  before me a feast of air to fill me up
  with only a feast of air to fill me up
  enjoying a feast of air to fill me up
  sitting at a banquet of nothing certain to fill us up
  sitting at a banquet of nothing certain to fill them up

# verse four

I, I found myself by the roadside
  I, I spent my days by the wayside
  I, I found myself by the wayside
  I, I found myself as an exile
  all of us, ever homeless
and trying to get to know you when my fears spoke up, I
  trying a conversation but we just cannot speak up
  trying a conversation but we just cannot look up
  trying a conversation but just our fears look up
  trying a conversation but they just will not look up
  trying a conversation but these wanderers won't look up
  trying to conversate but you just will not look up
I found myself without daylight
  I found myself in a landslide
I found myself without daylight when my fears started drowning me
  I found myself trying but the landslide of fear was interrupting me
  trying to find a new way before our fears interrupt
  trying to find a new way before our thoughts interrupt
  trying to find a new way before they interrupt
  trying to find a new way but they don't even interrupt
  trying to understand you but you just interrupt

# chorus

we've always known that somewhere is home
we've always known that somewhere is home
when I arrived you were the first to go
  when I was looking you were the first to go
  when I was thirsty you were the flood below
  while I was seeking you found it on your own
we've always known that elsewhere is home

Boxes
=====

I went looking for myself
we are homeless and afraid, but looking for a new way

I wandered through empty places
they don't listen to us; we're unsatisfied
so you go and give up your voice

they took away my mother tongue
  they took away my voice
  I never had a voice
  they're killing us
  they banished us
  they took our home
they don't listen to us; we're unsatisfied
so you go and give up your voice

# verse a

I, I ended up in a city
I ended up in a city where the winds cant
I, I ended up in a city
I ended up in a city where the winds can't land

I, I ended up in a building
I ended up in a building where my friends cant
I, I ended up in a building
I ended up in a building where my friends can't understand me

# verse b

all of us, ever homeless
finally prop up their eyelids, but they just drowse and blink
  finally open their earlids, but
  finally lift up their eyelids, but
  finally get them to listen, but they cough and blink
the sounds of their song dissolving behind their grinding teeth
  every last ounce of their kindness lurking behind blinding teeth
  every last ounce of their kindness pooling behind blinding teeth
  every last ounce of their kindness hiding behind blinding teeth
  every last ounce of their kindness hiding behind grinding teeth

all of us, ever exiled
only the night in the alley hasn't yet gone to sleep
  only the stone from these perils here at last set free
  only the trees in the valley laid their roots this deep
  only the trees in the valley remain but they weep
  only the trees in the valley can claim our home for sleep
  only the trees in the valley can claim to own the keep
  every remaining songbird seems to have lost its beak
only the wind in the valley remembers how to speak

and now you
and now you go and give up
and now you
and now you go and give up your tongue

in the long river below, there is a fish that doesn’t swim
there is a poisonous snake in the rocks near the ledge

we all went to the waterfall
we all went to where the water falls

# verse

we ended up in the city
we ended up in the city
the city where the winds' cant

we ended up in the city
we ended up in the city
the city where the winds' cant

is the song of those that left
is the song of those that left here


the winds' cant
is the song of those that left

---

We ended up in the city
the city where balloons land

The elk runs through Nehander
The elk runs through Nehander

We all went to the waterfall
We all went to where the water falls
We all went to the waterfall
We all went to where the water falls

One sat at the bottom
One climbed to the top
One wandered off
I'm sure he'll be back soon

---

We could not remember the days, so we asked the stones to remember for us
Men have left this city, so the trees came inside
The elk runs through Nehander
We left the city where the harp stands
I found myself in my own head
I found myself lost in a dream
You showed me the circular harp
You showed me the place we first(?) met
I showed you my hands and fire
I laid on the ground next to you


One sat at the bottom
One climbed to the top
One wandered off
They threw rocks
Our feet got wet
Our feet were bare
There is a poisonous snake in the rocks near the ledge
In the long river below, there is a fish that doesn’t swim
We laid our heads in the stream
The sun burned our backs
The trees there were thick
the stirring stick broke but I kept it
The string broke but I kept it
I twisted it up and took a picture
Did I show you the bird head I made out of string?
Did I show you the snake feet I made out of string?
I have come from where the hot air balloons are
I have come home from where the hot air balloons are

We ended up in the city
the city where the winds cant
  the city where the rain never lands
  the city where the birds don't land
  the city where balloons land
  the city where the birds land
  the city where the rains land
  the city full of plants
  the city where the days slant
  the city where no king commands

# prechorus

is the song of those that left
is the song of those that left here
is the song of those that left
is the song of those that left here

early morning
supernatural powers

and now you
  and you will
go and you
  go and give
and now you go and you spit out
  and you will go and give up
and now you
  and you will
and now you go and you spit out your tongue
  and you will go and give up your tongue
  and now the young tongue the ground
  and now the old man the boat
  and now the old home in on the road
  and now you go and spit out your tongue
  and now you spit it out
  and now you swallow the taste of your tongue
