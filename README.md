Lyrics

# verse

I, I ended up in a city
I ended up in a city where the sun beats

I, I ended up in a city
I ended up in a city where the sun beats down

I, I ended up in a building
I ended up in a building where the roof leaks

I, I ended up in a building
I ended up in a building where the roof leaks were drowning me

# prechorus

all of us, ever homeless
slowly sipping the moonlight steeping in our empty cups
sitting at a banquet of nothing certain to fill us up

all of us, foreign exiles
trying a conversation but you just will not look up
trying to understand you but you just interrupt


struck
cut
glut
abrupt
erupt
corrupt
reconstruct
interrupt
flux

look up

plenty of nothing to fill us up

look up



all of us homeless
lying alone, this
moonlight steeping in an empty cup

plenty of nothing to fill us up
plenty of nothing to fill us up


look up
look up
look up

faceless and boneless
  timeless and boneless
the night when we stole this
  as soon as we noticed
  so far when we noticed
  graceless and toneless



notice (narrator noticing something)
smokeless
toneless
focus
lotus
closeness (claustrophobic)

condolence
soulless
boldest / boldness

faceless and boneless
  leaving alone this

  skinless and boneless
  sleeping
  walking
  searching
  seeking
  looking


no supernatural powers


all of us without a home



in the long river below, there is a fish that doesn’t swim
there is a poisonous snake in the rocks near the ledge

we all went to the waterfall
we all went to where the water falls

# verse

we ended up in the city
we ended up in the city
the city where the winds' cant

we ended up in the city
we ended up in the city
the city where the winds' cant

is the song of those that left
is the song of those that left here




the winds' cant
is the song of those that left

---

We ended up in the city
the city where balloons land

The elk runs through Nehander
The elk runs through Nehander

We all went to the waterfall
We all went to where the water falls
We all went to the waterfall
We all went to where the water falls

One sat at the bottom
One climbed to the top
One wandered off
I'm sure he'll be back soon

---

We could not remember the days, so we asked the stones to remember for us
Men have left this city, so the trees came inside
The elk runs through Nehander
We left the city where the harp stands
I found myself in my own head
I found myself lost in a dream
You showed me the circular harp
You showed me the place we first(?) met
I showed you my hands and fire
I laid on the ground next to you


One sat at the bottom
One climbed to the top
One wandered off
They threw rocks
Our feet got wet
Our feet were bare
There is a poisonous snake in the rocks near the ledge
In the long river below, there is a fish that doesn’t swim
We laid our heads in the stream
The sun burned our backs
The trees there were thick
The string broke but I kept it
I twisted it up and took a picture
Did I show you the bird head I made out of string?
Did I show you the snake feet I made out of string?
I have come from where the hot air balloons are
I have come home from where the hot air balloons are

We ended up in the city
the city where the winds cant
  the city where the rain never lands
  the city where the birds don't land
  the city where balloons land
  the city where the birds land
  the city where the rains land
  the city full of plants
  the city where the days slant
  the city where no king commands

# prechorus

is the song of those that left
is the song of those that left here
is the song of those that left
is the song of those that left here

early morning
supernatural powers
